PDFT
====

PDFT is a library for creating a new PDF using an existing PDF as template for GO.
This library depend on [gopdf](https://github.com/signintech/gopdf)

This is still a proof of concept â€”not recommended to use in production.
I've tested with PDF template files created from Libre office, Google Docs, Microsoft Word.
